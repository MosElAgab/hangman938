## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

The project is built over several milestones as follow:

### Milestone 1: Environment Setup

Milestone 1 involves setting up the development environment, including the creation of a Conda environment named hangman_env. This ensures a consistent and isolated environment for running the game. Follow the installation instructions in the README to create the environment and install the necessary dependencies

### Milestone 2: Word Management and User Input

In this milestone, a naw module milestone_2.py has been added to the project, enhancing the game's functionality. This module handles the management of words, including the ability to input new words, choose a random word, get user guesses, and check the validity of the guesses. The module allows for a more dynamic and interactive experience for both users and developers.

### Milestone 3:  User Guess Validation and Word Checking

Milestone 3 introduces milestone_3.py, which builds upon the previous milestones. It includes functions for validating the user's guess, checking if the guess is in the chosen word, and providing appropriate feedback. This adds a crucial layer of interactivity and improves the overall gaming experience.
